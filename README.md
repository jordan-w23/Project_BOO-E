# Project_BOO-E
This is my Industrial designs project 3 for my 3rd year of Electrical Engineering studies. It is a proof of concept for a low cost autonomous vehicle using open-source recourses.
The system is broken down into 3 subsystems: Power, Navigation, Data logging
Ardupilot online forum is a key tool to use when setting up the flight controller and ground control station as most issues can be solved with a bit of research.
